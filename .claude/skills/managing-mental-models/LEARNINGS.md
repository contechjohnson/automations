## 2026-01-05 | Initial Setup

Created skill to manage three prime directives: Columnline, Prologis, Life.

Design decisions:
- Single skill for all three domains (they're interconnected)
- Markdown files, not Notion (reduce system complexity)
- Auto-detection patterns for when updates needed
- Cross-domain awareness built in

---

## Key Principles

### Keep It Simple
- One file per domain
- Standard markdown structure
- No complex tooling

### Cross-Domain Thinking
- Work in one area often affects others
- Energy is finite across all domains
- Priorities compete for attention

### Living Documents
- Update frequently, small edits
- Don't let them go stale
- Review weekly at minimum
