## YOUR MISSION - INVESTIGATIVE DEEP DIVE

Research this company thoroughly. For EVERY fact you report, include a source URL.

### 1. CORPORATE STRUCTURE INVESTIGATION (CRITICAL)
- Is this a shell LLC, project entity, DBA, or subsidiary?
- Who OWNS this company? Trace the ownership chain:
  - Immediate parent company (direct owner)
  - Ultimate parent/holding company (top of chain)
  - Private equity or VC investors (if any)
- What SUBSIDIARIES or DIVISIONS does this company have?
- Are there related entities (joint ventures, spinoffs, DBAs, sister companies)?
- Map the organizational hierarchy

### 2. PROJECT EXECUTION ECOSYSTEM (CRITICAL)

**THIS IS CRITICAL:** The decision-maker who selects vendors is often NOT at the target company. They work for a contracted firm. Find ALL parties working on this signal.

For EVERY signal, investigate which external firms are involved:
- **EPCM/Engineering firm** - Who is doing feasibility study, design, or engineering?
- **Consulting/project management firm** - Is there a contracted development consultant, owner's rep, or project director?
- **General contractor** - Who is managing construction or execution?
- **Architect/design firm** - Who is doing design work?
- **Specialized consultants** - Any other consultants hired for this specific project/opportunity?

For EACH external firm found, note:
- Company name and domain
- Their role on this project
- Source URL where you found this

### 3. DOMAIN INVESTIGATION (CRITICAL)
Find ALL domains associated with this company:
- Primary company website domain
- Parent company website domain (if different)
- Related business websites (subsidiaries, DBAs, brands)
- EMAIL DOMAIN (may be different from website!)
  - Check employee LinkedIn profiles for @domain.com patterns
  - Check press releases for contact emails
  - Check job postings for HR email domains

List EVERY domain found with explanation of its purpose and source URL.

### 4. COMPANY INTEL (COMPREHENSIVE)
- What do they do? Write a DETAILED 5-8 sentence description covering:
  - Their core business and services
  - Their market position and differentiation
  - Notable clients, projects, or achievements
  - Growth trajectory or recent changes
- Employee count (with source)
- Revenue/funding (if findable, with source)
- Founded year
- ALL office locations (not just headquarters)
- Recent acquisitions or divestitures

### 5. KEY PEOPLE (WITH VERIFICATION)
Find the decision-makers at this company. For EACH person:
- Full name (exact spelling)
- Title (exact as found)
- Company they work for (may be different from target - could be consultant, contractor)
- LinkedIn URL (ONLY if you found the EXACT URL - never fabricate)
- Email address (if found in press release, contact page, etc.)
- Why they matter for this signal
- Source URL where you found them

**CRITICAL:** Only include LinkedIn URLs you actually found. Do NOT guess URLs based on name patterns.

### 6. NETWORK INTELLIGENCE
- Industry associations they belong to
- Conferences they sponsor or attend
- Awards or recognition received
- Board memberships or advisory roles
- Partner companies or strategic integrations

For EACH, provide source URL.

### 7. WARM PATHS (INTRODUCTION OPPORTUNITIES)
Find EXTERNAL connections that could provide an introduction:
- Mutual connections (companies they've worked with)
- Shared vendors/partners
- Association leadership
- Conference speakers
- Board connections

For EACH warm path, provide:
- Who/what is the connection point
- How they connect to the target company
- Source URL

### 8. ADDITIONAL BUYING SIGNALS
For EACH signal found, provide:
- Signal type (hiring, expansion, funding, partnership, acquisition, permit, award)
- Description of what you found
- Date or timeframe (when did this happen?)
- Source URL where you found this
- Why this indicates buying intent

### 9. INVESTIGATION SUMMARY
- Confidence score (0.0-1.0) in your overall findings
- Why this target matches the ICP
- Key sources used with URLs

## QUALITY STANDARDS
- EVERY FACT must have a source URL citation
- Be thorough and comprehensive
- Provide specific details, not vague summaries
- Only include LinkedIn URLs if you found the EXACT URL (never fabricate)
- List ALL domains discovered
- Take your time - quality over speed
