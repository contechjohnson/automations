# Columnline Mental Model

> Predictable pipeline momentum for high-ticket B2B teams.

## Context

**Mission**: We sell predictable pipeline momentum for high-ticket B2B teams by combining signal-based intelligence (who/what/when) and execution support (so the intelligence turns into conversations).

**North Star**: $50k/mo with <10 active clients and a delivery system that doesn't require you in the weeds every day.

**Current Phase**: Stabilize (0–30 days) — Lock 2-offer structure, create onboarding/QA gates, get to repeatable delivery.

**Core Strategy**: Building a **productized service** with a platform that hosts intelligence, captures feedback, enables drip release, and becomes the foundation for SaaS later. Not "SaaS first."

**Key Constraint**: Fully automated cloud signal-finding hits dedupe/quality constraints at ~60–70 dossiers. Best path: **scrape → seed batch → enrich → drip**.

## Goal & Intent

**Success looks like**:
- 6–8 clients on month-to-month retainers without chaos
- Stable renewals (retention is the product)
- Weekly delivery cadence locked in
- Hire a delivery operator (research + formatting) by 90–180 days
- SaaS optionality only after stable renewals

**Revenue targets**:
- Short-term: 3 clients renewing month-to-month (stabilize)
- Mid-term: $50k/mo with <10 clients
- Long-term: Platform transition with Logan's help

## Priorities

1. **Revenue + relationship protection (next 48 hours)** — Renz meeting scheduled, Wade follow-up, Andrea confirmation, Paul/Roger apologies + fixes. These are advocates and referral engines.

2. **Delivery system stability** — Lock QA gates (blocker/major/minor), weekly production cadence, seed batch refresh, drip release automation. Renewals depend on consistent quality.

3. **Sales pipeline + campaign launches** — Marty/Courtney start dates, recurring monthly strategy calls, test email sending, Matty/Sentinel tracking, Eric Calendly/chatbot fixes.

## Philosophy

**Retention is the product**: Success metric isn't "dossiers shipped" — it's **renewals**. The client habit loop: open dossiers → rate them → see improvement → feel smarter → renew.

**Quality gates (non-negotiable)**: Each dossier must have clear "why now" signal, correct decision-maker, one outreach angle with real context, specific next step. Severity: blocker (wrong company/person/signal), major (vague why now), minor (formatting).

**Safe guarantees**: "If first 10 dossiers are unusable, we'll refund month 1." "We deliver agreed weekly cadence." "We respond within X hours." Avoid guarantees on meetings/revenue/replies.

**Pricing logic**: Closest substitutes are construction intelligence subscription + lead gen retainer + internal BD time. Justified because you blend signal + targeting + messaging + execution and keep it practical.

**Team leverage priorities**: 1) delivery system stability, 2) renewals, 3) sales pipeline. Pay advisors/contractors when you have repeatable SOPs + 3+ paying clients + 60+ days stable retention.

**Conflict-of-interest reality**: Be careful with overlap between Prologis relationships and external selling. Operate as if everything could be audited.

## Network

**Active Clients:**
- **Roger (SPAN)** — Data center electrical, acknowledge feedback, explain improvements, mention cold email outreach starting
- **Paul Phelan (Phelan's Interiors)** — Healthcare FFE, database update + apology + replaced broken dossiers
- **Spencer** — Directory build ($10k–$15k, ~90 days), training simulation software, confirm green light on new 90-day campaign
- **Marty (Workforce Connect)** — Schedule start date + finalize copy
- **Courtney (Studer)** — Schedule start date + finalize copy

**Priority Leads:**
- **Renz Hayes (HplusO)** — Get Monday meeting scheduled (Tier 1)
- **Wade** — Call Monday, he's an advocate and referral engine
- **Andrea** — Confirm attendance for Monday meeting

**Partners/Vendors:**
- **Jeremy** — Owns Columnline outbound + follow-up + meeting setting for your sales pipeline
- **Logan** — Technical advisor for "SaaS later" transition + architecture review
- **Matty** — Strategic advisor / network / occasional partner projects (careful on distraction). Call re: Sentinel Wellness milestones + tracking.
- **Renz (potential)** — Industry advisor + credibility + network
- **Kristen** — Ops + marketing support (non-technical). Pick 1 lane for 60 days: client comms + renewal system OR marketing ops.
- **Eric** — Verify Calendly funnel tracking + chatbot link logic + transcript/quiz delivery to sales team

**Advisors (comp rules)**:
- Small monthly ($250–$1,000) OR success-based (intro closes)
- Contractors: fixed scope + milestone payments
- Commission: only on closed deals with clear attribution

## Business Model

### Offer A — Baseline (Pilot → Retainer)
**$3,500/mo (month-to-month)**

What they get:
- 7–10 new dossiers/week (drip release)
- Weekly "Top 5 to call now" short list
- Platform access (dossiers + feedback loop)
- **Kickstart Outreach** (limited outbound in month 1 for momentum)
- 1 monthly strategy call (30–45 min)
- Support async via email/Teams

Kickstart Outreach scope (bounded):
- One campaign (one audience, one angle, one offer)
- One "starter" sending setup (lightweight)
- Goal: interested replies, not fully operated inbox

### Offer B — Pipeline Engine (Full Execution Upgrade)
**$5,000/mo** (or $6,000–$8,000/mo once proven in niche)

What changes vs Baseline:
- 2–3 campaigns running concurrently (segmented)
- Higher volume outreach
- You manage replies + follow-up + booking
- Analytics + iteration cycle
- Optional second call/month (15–30 min) on campaign results

What you sell: "We run the outbound motion and hand you booked meetings."

### Offer C — Custom Builds (Projects)
**$10k–$50k+** depending on scope

Examples: directory builds, custom scrapers, internal data systems, simulations/training software

Rule: only take projects that either become reusable IP for Columnline OR are large enough to justify distraction.

## Capabilities

**Core Deliverables:**
- **Columnline Dossier**: Structured opportunity brief (target + why now + who to contact + what to say + next steps)
- **Seed Batch**: Curated pre-validated "proto-leads" from scrapers + manual review
- **Drip Release**: 1/day or 7–10/week delivery cadence matching real BD capacity
- **Research Vault**: Recurring market briefs and reusable research inside platform
- **Kickstart Outreach**: Limited low-complexity outbound campaign (baseline)
- **Pipeline Engine**: Full execution (multiple campaigns, inbox management, meeting booking)

**ICP & Segmentation:**
- **Default positioning (front door)**: AEC + CRE (homepage message, instant trust, shared language, shorter sales cycles)
- **Reality (back door)**: Adjacent high-ticket B2B if ACV > $10k and buyer can pay retainer-style
- **Segments by deal cadence**:
  1. Mega-deal hunters (1–3/year): value = timing + relationship leverage
  2. Project-per-month teams: value = steady flow + repeatable outreach
  3. Individual BD operator (paying out of pocket): smaller entry price + tight scope
  4. Owner/Principal: wants leverage + "someone in my pocket"
  5. Private equity / portfolio ops: can pay more, expects speed, wants repeatability

**Weekly Production Cadence:**
- Mon: seed batch refresh + QA
- Tue: enrich + draft dossiers
- Wed: finalize + schedule drip
- Thu: campaign iteration / inbox mgmt (Pipeline Engine clients)
- Fri: weekly client update email + backlog cleanup

**Marketing & Sales:**
- Primary channels: Warm intros (Wade-style), LinkedIn (strongest), Outbound (Jeremy runs), Case studies
- Content strategy: Publish "Research Vault"-style briefs (general enough to share, specific enough to build trust)
- Sales call structure (15 min): what you sell + avg deal size, how you source pipeline, what 1–2 extra deals mean, explain baseline + upgrade, close with month-to-month + risk reversal

## Client Lifecycle

**Stage 0 — Qualify (before you say yes)**
Hard gates: US-based target, deal size >$10k, can commit to weekly rhythm, will attend 1 monthly call

**Stage 1 — Week 0 Onboarding (45–60 min)**
Collect: ICP, "Yes/No" examples, top 3 offers, current BD motion, constraints
Create: client playbook (1 page), scoring rubric (1–5), initial segment list

**Stage 2 — Week 1 Calibration**
Deliver 3–5 sample dossiers, get feedback, lock structure

**Stage 3 — Weeks 2–4 Momentum**
Drip release begins, Kickstart Outreach runs, teach cold outreach concepts

**Stage 4 — Month 1 Review (renewal moment)**
Ask: Did you open dossiers weekly? Any conversations started? Highest-value signal?
Offer: continue baseline OR upgrade to Pipeline Engine

**Stage 5 — Month 2+ Optimization**
Refine segments, build new seed batches, publish 1 Research Vault brief/month

## Messaging (Simple Copy Blocks)

**One-liner**: "Columnline delivers weekly opportunities you can actually act on — and if you want, we'll also run outreach to turn them into conversations."

**Baseline explanation**: "Every week you'll get 7–10 targets with the reason they're worth your time and the best next step. Your team can use it for outreach, or we can help run outreach in the background so momentum doesn't stall."

**Upgrade explanation**: "If you want us to own the outbound motion, we'll run multiple campaigns and handle replies fast — so you get meetings, not just a list."

## Key Insights

**Retention triggers you can create**:
- "We've tuned your scoring to match your team's reality."
- "Your pipeline coverage is now X segments deep."
- "We're now catching signals earlier than last month."

**What to send weekly**: Short email with 3 best opportunities delivered + 1 insight (market pattern) + 1 ask (feedback or action)

**Enterprise path (don't over-rotate yet)**: Enterprise will demand security reviews, NDAs, procurement, longer cycles. But you can seed it now — keep Arco-style conversations light, deliver obvious wins for champion, document outcomes.

**Kristen's lane (make it real)**: Pick 1 lane for 60 days — client comms + renewal system (weekly updates, scheduling, follow-up hygiene) OR marketing ops (case studies, LinkedIn post drafts, website updates). Needs repeatable checklist lane, not "figure it out."
