# Prologis Mental Model

> Day job context and priorities.

## Context

**Role**: Lean Construction Manager, Planning, Performance & Innovation (PPI) team

**Chain**: Kez Udezue (VP, Global Head of Development PPI) → Garrett Eskens (Director, Lean Construction) → Connor Johnson

**Function**: Bridge between construction execution and AI/technology innovation, championing continuous improvement across Prologis's global Development organization through:
- Lean construction processes and schedule optimization
- AI/technology innovation and implementation
- Knowledge management and sharing systems
- Training and cultural transformation

**Operating principles**:
1. **"Assist without taking over"** - Enable project teams, don't replace them
2. **Bridge technical and business** - Translate between development needs and IT capabilities
3. **Influence without authority** - Drive change through expertise and relationships
4. **Create pull, not push** - Make teams want lean involvement
5. **Quantify everything** - Track weeks saved, cost avoided, adoption rates
6. **Global knowledge sharing** - Local lessons benefit entire organization
7. **Continuous improvement culture** - Lean and AI as ongoing practices, not one-off projects

## Goal & Intent

**Career trajectory**: Become essential for capital deployment efficiency, support regional presidents' success metrics, build global reputation beyond Americas focus

**2025 goals**:
- Pull planning on ~95% of West Region projects
- Launch ROM Cost Intelligence & Project Stories
- Achieve ≥85% "very useful" rating on new tools
- Present PPR insights on 2+ global forums
- Partner with Energy & Mobility on 2+ projects
- Deliver ~25% schedule improvement on engaged projects

**Success looks like**:
- PPI positioned as "go-to group for innovation"
- Direct access to Kez Udezue for major initiatives
- Building relationships across Mobility, Energy, Essentials
- Quantified results that get executive attention
- Each successful project creates advocates

## Priorities

1. **ROM Cost Intelligence Tool (Flagship)** — $53K investment, standardizes decision quality, activates dormant cost data, timing advantage in competitive markets. Architecture: SharePoint/Power Apps → Power Automate → Snowflake → OpenAI → PDF. Key question: "How do I make sure this runs if I leave?"

2. **Core Lean Operations (Schedule Review + Pull Planning + PPR)** — The foundation. 313 weeks saved in 2024, $6.6M carry cost reduction. Every week saved = ~$42K. Coverage: ~95% of West Region projects. This is the credibility engine.

3. **Project Stories + Knowledge Systems** — AI-generated project summaries, metadata schema, SharePoint library, PPR GPT (1,200+ queries). Turn completed projects into searchable intelligence. Target: 80% of 2018-2025 projects.

## Philosophy

**Data drives credibility**: Quantified results get executive attention. Schedule compression is the currency.

**Relationships compound**: Each successful project creates advocates. Early involvement is key - pre-construction influence has highest impact.

**Innovation + execution**: AI tools must deliver practical field value, not just demos. Global consistency matters - standardization enables scale.

**Execution scaffolding**: Week plans, 1:1 recaps, project-specific working memory pages. Single page per project: context + actions.

**Culture-building function**: Team events, content from successful calls, AI Champions features. Making AI work "human and relational, not just technical."

## Architectural Thinking Patterns

When building AI systems:
- **Chat interface vs backend custom action?** How visible should the AI be?
- **Agent architectures vs simple completions?** When does orchestration matter?
- **How do I make sure this runs if I leave?** Sustainability and ownership
- **SharePoint → Power Automate → Snowflake → OpenAI** - How do the pieces wire together?

Not just building tools - building **patterns** for how Prologis AI systems should be deployed and owned.
