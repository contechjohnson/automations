# Life Mental Model

> Protect the time with my kids while building the future they deserve.

## Context

**Age**: 32, male, Castle Rock, Colorado

**Family**: Married to Kristen Johnson, two kids (Milo - 5, Scarlett - 3.5), third on the way (due August 2026)

**Current reality**: In the middle of the best years for toddlers. Want nothing more than to enjoy time with them. But everything I do right now is absolutely consuming me. I'm so busy. Missing hours with my kids for everything I do wrong or don't think through.

**The tension**: Can't be completely overwhelmed doing the Prologis job AND this company. Need to get out of Prologis fast AND get Columnline stable, doing revenue, providing for my family, and growing.

**The stake**: Proved to my wife we can have three kids because I'm making $200k at Prologis + $200k/year at Columnline. But I can't live in a constant state of overwhelm.

**Housing**: ~$600k home in Castle Rock (The Meadows), 2,700 sq ft. Kids will sleep in bunk beds when baby is born. Would love to move to bigger house, get more space. Always imagined big city, nice neighborhood, kids in private school.

**Finances**: Making ~$10k/month (net) from Prologis. Spending ~$1k over that every month. Daycare is $4k/month ($2k per kid). Milo starts kindergarten soon (about a year without daycare). Budget is out of control. Mortgage is $2,700.

**Vehicles**: All paid off, nice cars, but too small now. Need to upgrade.

**Extended family**: Two brothers (very close but not close - different parts of country), older sister (different part of country), parents estranged. Mom will be a burden soon (no health insurance), may have to help her. Dad is out there, self-absorbed, but capable. In-laws are great.

## Goal & Intent

**What success looks like**:
- Exit the fiat economy. No boss. No waking up and driving somewhere to give a bullshit 8-hour day for something I can't get excited about.
- CEO/founder. Do whatever projects I want.
- Kids afford a better life: nice schools, vacations, skiing, money for college.
- Kids learn what it's like to be an entrepreneur early (not at 30/32 like me).
- Pregnant wife doesn't have to work to help us pay bills.
- Kids don't have to worry.
- So much money that worries about the future of the family go away.
- Stable business where my identity is solidified in my own mind.
- Happy again. Prove I'm the great person I thought I'd be when I was younger.

**What I want**:
- Move to bigger house
- Upgrade cars
- Private school for kids
- Nice neighborhood
- Vacations, skiing
- Financial security for 3 kids
- Help mom if needed
- Time to actually be present with kids

## Priorities

1. **Protect time with kids while moving ruthlessly fast** — Every hour I waste is an hour I miss with them. Must be ruthlessly efficient because I'm missing hours with my kids for everything I don't do right. Can't slack on their birthday parties, friends with kids, etc.

2. **Exit Prologis, stabilize Columnline to $200k+/year** — Need to prove this works. Need the income to support 3 kids. Need my wife to not have to work. Need to solidify my identity as founder/CEO. This is the path to freedom.

3. **Get budget under control, upgrade space/vehicles** — Spending $1k over $18k/month income is not sustainable. Daycare will drop soon (Milo → kindergarten). Need bigger house, bigger cars. Need to stop the financial anxiety.

## Philosophy

**Time is the currency**: Can't get hours with Milo and Scarlett back. Every inefficiency, every wrong decision, every moment of being overwhelmed is time I'm not present with them.

**Push past this phase**: Have to commit and push harder. Be ruthlessly efficient. This is temporary pain for permanent freedom.

**Build the future they deserve**: Want my kids to have options. Nice schools. Vacations. College paid for. Learn entrepreneurship early. Not worry about money.

**Exit fiat, exit bosses**: Don't want to work for someone else. Don't want to drive to an office. Don't want to give 8 hours to something I can't get excited about. Want autonomy to do whatever projects I want.

**Prove the great person I thought I'd be**: Jumped around (civil engineering → army → builder/developer → Prologis). Now it's time to land it. Founder. CEO. Exit. Freedom.

**Identity crisis is real**: Wife's identity is tied to working, but I don't have a great place for her yet. Tried admin, marketing, copywriting, customer success (not going great, doesn't follow up). This is a tension point.

**Financial pressure drives everything**: Mom will be a burden soon (no health insurance). Need to be able to help her. Need to support 3 kids. Need to upgrade house/cars. Need to stop overspending.

## Network

**Immediate Family:**
- **Kristen Johnson** (wife) — Helps with business (admin, some marketing/copywriting/customer success). Identity tied to working. Handles house admin, does some super well, but budget is out of control. Doesn't follow up consistently on customer success stuff yet.
- **Milo Johnson** (son, 5 years old) — Birthday Jan 13. Starting kindergarten soon. Bunk beds when baby is born.
- **Scarlett Johnson** (daughter, 3.5 years old) — Birthday Jul 13. Bunk beds when baby is born.
- **Baby #3** (due August 2026)
- **Dog** — Getting older. Feel guilty about not taking him out as much.

**Extended Family:**
- **Two brothers** — Very close but not close (different parts of country). Lower priority at moment.
- **Sister** — Bit older, different part of country. Lower priority.
- **Mom** — Estranged. Will be a burden soon (no health insurance). May have to help financially.
- **Dad** — Estranged, out there, self-absorbed. Capable and competent though. He'll be fine.
- **In-laws** — Great, no complaints.

**Friends:**
- Lower priority at the moment.
- **Need**: Friends who have kids so my kids have people at their birthday parties.

## Health

**Physical activity I love**:
- **Weightlifting** (favorite) — Follow 5-3-1 protocol (Jim Wendler, Boring But Big). Lifted pretty heavy: 320 bench, 450 deadlift.
- **Rock climbing** — Used to love, don't do as much now
- **Skiing** — Used to do, want to do with kids
- **Mountain biking** — Still do sometimes
- **Fly fishing** — Still do sometimes
- **Outdoors** — Used to be a big part of life

**Hobbies I've lost**:
- Drawing
- Video games (still do sometimes)
- Handyman/basic maintenance (not handy, but can figure stuff out)

**Current reality**: Not enough time for any of this. Overwhelmed. Missing the physical activity that makes me feel good.

## Household

**Home**: ~$600k, 2,700 sq ft, The Meadows (Castle Rock, CO)

**Vehicles**: All paid off, nice, but too small for 3 kids. Need upgrade.

**Division of labor**:
- Kristen handles house admin (some super well, some not — budget is out of control)
- Connor handles Prologis + Columnline (overwhelmed)

**Daycare**: $4k/month ($2k per kid). Milo starts kindergarten soon (about 1 year break from full daycare costs).

**Budget**: Spending ~$1k over $18k/month Prologis income. Out of control. Need visibility and discipline.

## Todos

**Family:**
- [ ] Find friends with kids for Milo and Scarlett's birthday parties
- [ ] Plan for baby #3 (August 2026) — space, budget, logistics

**Health:**

- [ ] Calculate minimum Columnline revenue to replace Prologis income
- [ ] Track Columnline revenue toward $200k/year target

**Kristen's Lane:**
- [ ] Define Kristen's role more clearly (marketing? customer success? admin?)
- [ ] Set up repeatable checklist for her lane (not "figure it out")
- [ ] Decide if she stays working or transitions out as Columnline grows

**Extended Family:**
- [ ] Plan for Mom's health insurance / financial burden
- [ ] Reconnect with brothers (even if just quarterly calls)

## Career Arc (For Context)

**Journey so far**: Civil engineering → Army (not a fit, but did pretty good) → Builder/developer (Majestic Commerce/Majestic Realty) → Prologis (better job, good title) → **Now: Founder/CEO (Columnline)**

**What I want**: Exit Prologis. Be CEO. Do whatever projects I want. Exit the fiat economy. No boss. Autonomy. Freedom.

**What I'm proving**: That I'm the great person I thought I'd be when I was younger. That I can land it. That I can provide for my family on my own terms.

## Cross-Domain Tensions

**Columnline client work** → Blocks time with kids. Need to be ruthlessly efficient.

**Prologis late nights** → Miss bedtime, miss mornings. Drains energy. Need to exit.

**Budget out of control** → Financial anxiety. Affects everything. Need to fix.

**Kristen's identity tied to work** → She wants to work, but role isn't locked yet. Tension in household.

**Mom's future burden** → Will need financial help. Adds pressure to make Columnline work.

**Kids need friends** → Can't slack on birthday parties, playdates, social stuff. Need to prioritize this.

## What Would Make This Amazing

**Financial**: So much money that worries about the future of the family go away. $200k+/year from Columnline, stable, repeatable. Bigger house. Bigger cars. Private school. Vacations. College funds.

**Identity**: Stable business where my identity is solidified in my own mind. CEO/Founder. Exited Prologis. Doing projects I choose. Happy again.

**Time**: Not living in constant state of overwhelm. Present with kids. Not missing hours with Milo and Scarlett. Not giving 8 bullshit hours to something I can't get excited about.

**Freedom**: Exit the fiat economy. No boss. Autonomy. Do whatever I want. Prove I'm the great person I thought I'd be.

## Learnings

### 2026-01-06 | Milo said I wasn't watching

**What happened:** At soccer practice, was on phone. Milo told me I wasn't watching him.

**Why it matters:** Five-year-olds don't manipulate — they just tell you what they see. He noticed. That means it's a pattern, not a one-off.

**The fix:** Phone in the car at his activities. Period. Be bored. Watch him miss the ball. That's the job.

**The bigger lesson:** Core memories are forming now. "Dad was at my games" vs "Dad was on his phone at my games" — that's the difference.

**New rule:** Phone stays in car at kids' practices and games. Non-negotiable.
